'''
When you see an r in front of a string in Python, it means that the string is a raw string. Raw strings treat backslashes (\) as literal characters and do not interpret them as escape characters.

Explanation
In a regular (non-raw) string, certain sequences starting with a backslash (\) have special meanings, such as \n for newline, \t for tab, and \\ for a literal backslash.

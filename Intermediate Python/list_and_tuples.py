# LISTS

'''A list is a collection where you can keep many items together'''

# Creating a list of toys
toys = ['ball', 'car', 'doll', 'blocks']

'''You can do lots of things with lists, like adding new toys or taking some out.'''
print(toys)

# Adding a new toy to the list
toys.append('teddy bear')

print(toys)

# Removing a toy from the list
toys.remove('car')

print(toys)

# Printing all toys in the list
#print(toys)



# TUPLES

'''A tuple is simply a list but doesn't change'''

# Creating a tuple for a pair of socks
socks = ('blue', 'red', 'green', "pink")

# Accessing items in a tuple
first_sock = socks[0]
second_sock = socks[1]

# Printing the socks
#print("First sock:", first_sock)
#print("Second sock:", second_sock)
